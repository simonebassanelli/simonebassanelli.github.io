I am a Pd.D. student in Cognitive Science at the University of Trento (https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0230360/Didattica) and in the MoDiS lab at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler (https://modis.fbk.eu/) specializing in gamification design, application and UX analysis.
I'm also an international visiting student at The Games Institute (https://uwaterloo.ca/games-institute/). 
My research is focused on developing an holistic process for designing and evaluating gamified solutions taking into account the contextual information, the game modality and the device used, implemented in a tool (https://gamidoc.vercel.app/).

Outside of university, I am a musician, a beer taster, a cat-lover and a parkour practitioner.
