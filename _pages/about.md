I am a PhD student in the departmente of Psychology and Cognitive Science at the University of Trento 
and a researcher in the MoDiS lab at the Fondazione Bruno Kessler.
Actually, I am an international visiting student at The Games Institue in Waterloo, Canada.

My research interest is the study of video games, serious games, VR, and gamification.
I am currently developing an holistic procedure to help in design and evaluate gamified solutions.
